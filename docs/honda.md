# Honda Sensing Elite

Honda claims Level 3 (i.e. "eyes off" but not "mind off") for the Legend Hybrid EX. However, it's limited to 100 lease cars in Japan, and the Level 3 bit is "Traffic Jam Pilot" - which Honda says means the driver can watch TV while in congested traffic. In addition, it has adaptive cruise and lane centering which gives Level 2 (hands off but not eyes off) on the highway. The vehicle can change langes on its own, but also at direction of driver activating the turn signal.
