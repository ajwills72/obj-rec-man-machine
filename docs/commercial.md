## Some thoughts on commercial R&D

Anecdotally, it seems likely that commercial investment in AI research now far outstrips government funding. For example, if even just 10% of Tesla's [2021 R&D budget](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/research-development-expenses) was on AI, that's $240m, which exceeds, for example, the total [budget for the ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UKRI-270521-UKRI-Allocation-Explainer-2021-22-FINAL-PDF.pdf) in the same year (digressing a bit, but note that around 25% of UKRI funding for research is via QR - the REF mechanism - the remainder comes from grants). 

And, of course, Tesla is far from the only company doing AI R&D.
