# Waymo

What object-recognition capacities do these have? How do they work?

Waymo offers driverless taxis to the general public in Pheonix, Arizona, but the vehicles have [remote human overseers][arstechnica2020] that deal with tricky situations like selecting a new route if encountering roadworks. The cars can also only operate in an area that has been detailed mapped by Waymo, and then driven with safety drivers. This took three years for 50 square miles. Note also that Pheonix suburbs have wide roads, few pedestrains, and it's nearly always sunny and seldom rains.
